Using [DisableAutoCreation] for debugging

- Works with SystemBase and ISystem
- If you suspect a system may be causing some unexpected behavior, disable it to eliminate the possibility of that system causing it
- When refactoring a system for a better implementation, disable the original system, then create a new system. Now you can use the attribute to toggle between the two to compare
- Can be used if you want to control when a system is created, i.e. from a UI/game event or when the scene loads
